PREORDER:  ROOT LEFT RIGHT
INORDER:   LEFT ROOT RIGHT
POSTORDER: LEFT RIGHT ROOT
When you declare a class which has a constructor which takes no argument, you don't put "()"
while declaring an instance of that class. For ex:

class Queue q1;  //Correct
class Queue q1();//incorrect

When the constructor takes argument, then you put that inside the bracket like this:
class Queue q1(size);

In functions in tree problems, always write this:
if(root == NULL)
{
    return;
}
//this is to handle the case when you are passed a null pointer
