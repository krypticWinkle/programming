Everything began on exact time as told before.
 
The interviewer came, greeted "Hi Ayush", to which I greeted back - "Hello sir, good evening! How are you?"
Then he briefly introduced himself in 30 secs. He said that was working with Amazon for last 2 years. And he was in some transaction type work
or in a team that does so. Then I too introduced myself in about the same time, in brief. Now the interviewer said: "Shall we directly start?" I said 
"yeah, sure".


He gave me this question:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-large-number-check-subsequence-digits-divisible-8/

We had a very long discussion for 1 hour, optimizing the solution, discussing time and space complexities, writing the  code. I told him a solution 
in O(n^2) and he seemed fine with that. But there's a solution to this in O(n) on gfg.



Immediate Takeaways 

Revise time/space complexity properly
Practice more more more more more ..........................................................

Long term takeaways:
You have to be too good in DP.

Takeaways from friends' interviews
